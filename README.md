// Write a program that lets a maker of chips and salsa keep track of sales for five different types of salsa: mild, 
// medium, sweet, hot, and zesty. 

//The program should use two parallel 5-element arrays: an array of strings that holds 
// the five salsa names, DONE 

// and an array of integers  that holds the numers of jars sold  during the last past month for 
// each salsa type. 


// The salsa names should be stored using an initialization list at the time the name is created. 
// The program should pront the user to enter the number of jards sold for each type. 


// and the name of the highest selling 

// and lowest selling products.

// Input validation: Do not accept nagative values for the number of the jars sold
